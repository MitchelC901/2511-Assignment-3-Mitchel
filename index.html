            My name is Mitchel Virath Chanthaseng. I was born in Calgary, Alberta where I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of
            Computer Information Systems at Mount Royal Univeristy. Regarding my personal activities, I try to consistantly 
            be active whenever I can, whether itâ€™s working out by myself or playing sports like badminton and soccer with some friends.
            Additionally, after graduating from high school I've had quite a bit of experience working different jobs from 
            military reserves to warehousing and retail.<br><br>
