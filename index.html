            My name is Mitchel Virath Chanthaseng. I was born in Calgary, Alberta where I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of
            Computer Information Systems at Mount Royal Univeristy. Regarding my personal activities, I try to consistantly 
            be active whenever I can whether itâ€™s by myself or with some friends playing sports like badminton and soccer.
            Additionally, after graduating from high school, I've had quite a bit of experience working different jobs from 
            military reserves to warehousing and retail.
